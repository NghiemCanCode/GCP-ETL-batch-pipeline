# Data Samples

## Overview
This folder contains a small sample or cached dataset extracted from storage/database.  
It is intended to give data engineers a quick preview before building a complete data pipeline.

## Usage
- The data can be used in notebooks for exploration and prototyping.  
- It can also serve as test samples for pipeline development and validation.

## Notes
In this project, since the dataset is static, the data files are stored directly in this folder.
